This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tic Tac Toe
React components were used to construct a tic tac toe board with buttons that alternate displaying 'X' or 'O' when clicked.
The status of all 9 squares and a user-input text note are stored for each turn in a component state variable.
The game can be reset to any turn using another set of buttons.
